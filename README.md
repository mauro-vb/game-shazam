<h4> GAME DETECTIVE </h4>

- Created by [mauro-vb](https://github.com/mauro-vb/), [WideRoger](https://github.com/WideRoger) and [julianr-data](https://github.com/julianr-data/).
- We trained a deep learning model that can recognize over 40 videogame titles from screenshots. 
- To do this we coded a scraping tool and created a database of over half a million images, soon to be available.
- You can check it out [here.](https://mauro-vb-game-shazam-appapp-streamlit-front-cezsjk.streamlit.app/) The first guess always takes a little bit more, so be patient! ðŸ˜Š
